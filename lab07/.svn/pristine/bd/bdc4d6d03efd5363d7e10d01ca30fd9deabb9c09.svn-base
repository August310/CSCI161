        /** For this part of the assignment you will be creating a loop that reads
         *   in integer values entered by a user using the console until they enter a
         *   negative number, at which point the loop should quit and display (print out) the
         *   following information:
         *
         *   count - the number of iterations made by the loop
         *   total - the total of all values entered (excluding the negative value)
         *   minimum - the smallest number entered by the user
         *    Note: use the value -1 if no values were entered (the user initially entered a negative number)
         *   maximum - the largest number entered by the user
         *    Note: use the value -1 if no values were entered (the user initially entered a negative number)
         *
         *  When outputting the results it should be of a form similar to the following:
         *   (Make sure that capitalization, punctuation, and spelling matches)
         *  Note that this output is something your code should do independently of any
         *   output generated by the main method that runs your code.
         *
         *   Output:
         *   count: 4
         *   total: 24
         *   minimum: 0
         *   maximum: 20
         *
         *  Your loop should also be type-safe in that the program will not crash if
         *   non-integer data is encountered. You should display a message similar
         *   to the following if the user enters a non-integer value:
         *   "That is not an integer, please try again."
         *     (Hint: The error message MUST contain at least the phrase "not an integer")
         *
         *  Note: Make sure to include a message prompting a user to enter integer
         *   numbers or a negative number to quit before reading any input.
         *     (Hint: The prompt message MUST include the keywords "Enter" and "negative")
         *
         *  Note: This program contains a main method that can be used to manually test your code
         *   by right-clicking Question1.java and selecting "Run File"
