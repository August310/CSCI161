    /*  For this portion of the assignment, you will be creating a simple animation
        of a ball that moves around the screen of an applet and bounces off of the
        walls.

        You may wish to view the pre-recorded video on Animation before completing this part
        of the assignment. The approach used here differs from those presented in the text book

        As part of this assignment, you will need to have first completed the Ball class.

        1) Create an instance of the Ball class and make sure it can draw itself
        2) Complete the detectCollisions method that determines when your Ball object
            has collided with any of the walls, in which case it should reverse direction.
        3) Create an instance of the Timer class and assign it an ActionListener that
            moves the ball around and repaints the screen every time it triggers its event
    */

    public Animation()
    {
        // Set the size of the Window
        super.setSize(400, 400);

        // Terminate the Program when closing the Window
        super.setDefaultCloseOperation(javax.swing.WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        // Create, configure, and start your Timer here


    }

    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g)

    public void detectCollisions()

    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
