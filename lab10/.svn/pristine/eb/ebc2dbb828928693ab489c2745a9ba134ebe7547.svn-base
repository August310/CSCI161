    /*  For this portion of the assignment, you will writing a simple method to perform basic reads from a specified file, the name
        of which will be passed in as an argument to the method below. 
    
        You can use the Scanner class to read from a file (Chapter 11.3)
    
        Your code should perform the following actions:
    
        1) If the parameter fileName is null, you should change it to a default value of "files/question3/sample.txt"
        2) Read the file line by line and keep track of all of the input you have read, which will be returned as a String
            * Make sure to preserve spacing and other special characters. 
        3) If the specified file could not be found, you should return the String "Error: Could not find file!"
            * Your code should not throw any exceptions. 
    
        *Note: You should not print anything to the console for this exercise. 
        *Note: You will need to import some classes from the java.io package.
